## looking for a job

I can make some things for games and also **games**. I can automate small stuff, maybe even **big** stuff. I can do LaTeX/TikZ (not only math), procedural generation, proper formating of code, write clearer-than-average descriptions for programming things. And most importantly, I can make stuff work even if the stuff shouldn't work. I like math by the way.

## previous work experience

Worked for 3 months as a junior creative JS/TS developer at [glitch.ge](https://glitch.ge), was cool.

## me

I like rockets. Procedural generation rocks. [Contact me](https://dimitri.ge/#contact-me).

## thoughts about teaching

Teaching is cool. I like doing it. It makes me feel good.

## job

I want one
